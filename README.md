## Abstract

This research presents a novel application of **Neural Hawkes Processes (NHP)** to macroeconomic event prediction, specifically targeting significant shocks in U.S. Treasury interest rates and energy commodity prices. We reformulate the problem of predicting macroeconomic regime changes as a **multivariate marked temporal point process**, where discrete "events" represent statistically significant deviations from historical norms.

Our methodology bridges the gap between continuous-time deep learning models and practical forecasting by introducing:

1. **A principled event extraction framework** that converts monthly price series into marked point processes
2. **Cross-excitation feature engineering**: Using transport-sensitive food commodities (bacon, chicken, eggs, citrus) as **leading indicators** for energy shocks
3. **A PyTorch implementation** of the Neural Hawkes Process with modern training practices
4. **A comprehensive evaluation protocol** that separates "any-event timing" from "event-type ranking"
5. **Rigorous baseline comparisons** including VAR, Logistic Regression, and MLP classifiers

**Key Finding**: By incorporating food commodities with high transport-cost sensitivity as cross-excitation sources, we improve fuel/energy shock prediction from F1 ~0.10 to **F1 = 0.364** for Fuel Oil at H=3 months, demonstrating that **supply chain dynamics encode information about future energy price movements**.

## 1. Research Motivation

Traditional time-series forecasting methods treat macroeconomic data as continuous signals, applying techniques like ARIMA, GARCH, or recurrent neural networks to predict future values. However, market practitioners and risk managers are often more concerned with **discrete events**—significant regime changes, price shocks, or volatility spikes—rather than point predictions.

**The core insight** of this research is that macroeconomic shocks exhibit **self-exciting** and **cross-exciting** dynamics:

- A shock in Treasury Notes rates may trigger subsequent shocks in Treasury Bonds
- Energy price spikes often cluster temporally due to supply chain propagation
- Financial stress in one instrument category can cascade to others

The **Hawkes Process** is the natural mathematical framework for modeling such phenomena. Originally developed for earthquake aftershock sequences, Hawkes processes have found applications in:

- High-frequency trading and limit order book dynamics
- Social media cascade prediction
- Crime hotspot analysis
- Credit default contagion

**Our contribution** is applying the **Neural Hawkes Process**—a deep learning extension that replaces parametric intensity functions with continuous-time LSTMs—to macroeconomic shock prediction at monthly resolution.

### Why This Matters

1. **Risk Management**: Anticipating clusters of adverse events enables better hedging strategies
2. **Policy Analysis**: Understanding cross-excitation between Treasury instruments and commodities informs monetary policy transmission studies
3. **Portfolio Construction**: Event-driven strategies benefit from probabilistic forecasts of shock occurrence

---

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

We model macroeconomic dynamics as a **multivariate marked temporal point process** defined over continuous time \( t \in [0, T] \).

**Definition**: An event \( e_i = (t_i, k_i, m_i) \) consists of:
- \( t_i \): Timestamp (continuous, in months)
- \( k_i \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \): Event type (e.g., "Treasury Notes UP", "Fuel Oil DOWN")
- \( m_i \in \mathbb{R}^+ \): Mark (magnitude of the shock)

The **conditional intensity function** \( \lambda_k(t | \mathcal{H}_t) \) specifies the instantaneous rate of type-\( k \) events given history \( \mathcal{H}_t = \{(t_i, k_i, m_i) : t_i < t\} \).

**Classical Hawkes Process**:
$$\lambda_k(t) = \mu_k + \sum_{t_i < t} \alpha_{k_i, k} \cdot \phi(t - t_i)$$

where \( \mu_k \) is the base intensity, \( \alpha_{k_i, k} \) captures cross-excitation, and \( \phi(\cdot) \) is an exponential decay kernel.

**Neural Hawkes Process**: Replaces the linear summation with a continuous-time LSTM that maintains a hidden state \( h(t) \) evolving between events:

$$\lambda_k(t) = f_k(h(t))$$

where \( f_k \) is a neural network and \( h(t) \) interpolates exponentially between event times.

### 2.2 Event Extraction Pipeline

**Step 1: Data Preprocessing**

Starting from monthly price series for 21 instruments, we compute log-differences:

$$\Delta_t = \log(P_t) - \log(P_{t-1})$$

This transforms prices into stationary returns suitable for normalization.

**Feature Categories** (carefully selected based on lagged correlation analysis):

| Category | Instruments | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Target: Fuel/Energy** | Fuel oil #2, Gasoline (all types), Gasoline (unleaded) | Primary prediction targets |
| **Interest Rates** | 11 Treasury rate categories | Lead fuel via storage costs, futures pricing |
| **Transport-Sensitive Food** | Bacon, Chicken, Eggs, Oranges, Lemons, Steak, Ground beef | **Leading indicators** for energy shocks |

The food commodities were selected based on **lagged correlation analysis**:
- Chicken breast: +0.18 correlation with *next month's* fuel prices
- Lemons: +0.17 lagged correlation
- Bacon: +0.15 lagged correlation
- Oranges: +0.27 contemporaneous correlation

**Economic Intuition**: Supply chains adjust to anticipated energy costs. When transportation-intensive foods (meat, citrus) show price movements, this may signal upcoming fuel price changes that are already being factored into logistics costs.

**Step 2: Train-Only Standardization**

To prevent lookahead bias, we compute z-scores using only training period (2014–2020) statistics:

$$z_t = \frac{\Delta_t - \hat{\mu}_{\text{train}}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\text{train}}}$$

**Step 3: Threshold-Based Event Extraction**

Events are defined as z-scores exceeding a threshold \( \tau = 2.0 \):

- **UP event**: \( z_t \geq \tau \) (significant increase)
- **DOWN event**: \( z_t \leq -\tau \) (significant decrease)

This yields \( K = 42 \) event types (21 instruments × 2 directions).

**Step 4: Continuous-Time Encoding**

Within each month, multiple events are ordered deterministically (by column index) with small time offsets \( \epsilon = 10^{-3} \) to ensure strictly increasing timestamps.

**Rationale for Design Choices**:

| Choice | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Log-differences | Stationarity; interpretable as returns |
| Train-only normalization | Prevents information leakage |
| \( \tau = 2.0 \) | Captures ~2.3% tail events (assuming normality) |
| UP/DOWN separation | Asymmetric dynamics in financial markets |

### 2.3 Neural Hawkes Architecture

Our implementation follows Mei & Eisner (2017) with modifications for modern PyTorch:

```
Input: Sequence of events (t_i, k_i, m_i)
    ↓
Embedding Layer: k_i → e_k ∈ ℝ^32, m_i → scalar projection
    ↓
Continuous-Time LSTM Cell:
    - c(t) = c̄_i + (c_{i-1} - c̄_i) · exp(-δ_i · (t - t_{i-1}))
    - h(t) = o_i ⊙ tanh(c(t))
    ↓
Intensity Head: h(t) → softplus(W · h(t) + b) → λ(t) ∈ ℝ^K
```

**Key Architectural Decisions**:

1. **Softplus activation** for intensity: Ensures \( \lambda_k(t) > 0 \) with stable gradients
2. **Exponential decay** in cell state: Captures memory decay between events
3. **Mark embedding**: Shock magnitudes modulate the hidden state update
4. **Small model** (32 embed, 64 hidden): Appropriate for ~120 training months

**Training Objective**:

Maximum likelihood estimation via Monte Carlo integration:

$$\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i} \log \lambda_{k_i}(t_i) - \int_0^T \sum_k \lambda_k(t) \, dt$$

The integral is approximated using 8 uniformly sampled points per inter-event interval.

### 2.4 Evaluation Framework

A critical contribution of this work is the **realistic evaluation protocol** that separates two distinct prediction tasks:

#### Task 1: Month-Level "Any Event?" Decision

**Question**: Will *any* significant shock occur in the next H months?

**Metrics**:
- **AUC-ROC**: Discrimination ability
- **Brier Score**: Calibration
- **Precision/Recall/F1**: At validation-tuned threshold

**Why This Matters**: A trader deciding whether to hedge needs to know if *something* will happen, not necessarily *what*.

#### Task 2: Event-Type Ranking

**Question**: *Given* that events will occur, which types are most likely?

**Metrics**:
- **MAP (Mean Average Precision)**: Overall ranking quality
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Position of first correct prediction
- **nDCG@k**: Normalized discounted cumulative gain
- **Top-k Hit Rate**: Does any true event appear in top-k predictions?
- **Per-Type F1**: Classification performance for each event type

**Why This Matters**: A macro analyst needs to know *which* Treasury instruments or commodities to monitor.

#### No-Lookahead Protocol

All predictions use **only historical information**:

1. At month \( m \), observe history \( \mathcal{H}_{< m} \)
2. Integrate intensity \( \lambda_k(t) \) over \( [m, m+H] \)
3. Convert to probability: \( P_k = 1 - \exp(-\int \lambda_k \, dt) \)
4. Compare against actual events in \( [m+1, m+H] \)

| H=1 month | 0.418 | 0.347 | 66.7% | 100% | **80.0%** |
| H=3 months | **0.700** | **0.069** | — | — | — |

| MRR | 0.326 |
| Top-5 Hit Rate | 33.3% |
| Top-10 Hit Rate | **76.2%** |

|----------------|----------|----------|------|
| Eggs (UP) | 0.250 | **0.455** | Leading indicator |
| Eggs (DOWN) | 0.250 | **0.500** | Leading indicator |

| Chicken breast (UP) | 0.250 | 0.308 | Leading indicator |
| Bacon (UP) | 0.091 | 0.286 | Leading indicator |

**Key Insight**: These food commodities with high transport costs show strong predictive power, validating our hypothesis that supply chain dynamics encode information about future energy prices.

## 5. Key Takeaways

### 5.1 Cross-Excitation Feature Engineering Dramatically Improves Energy Predictions

The **Commodity Exogeneity Puzzle** (why are fuel/energy shocks hard to predict?) was partially solved by incorporating **transport-sensitive food commodities** as leading indicators:

| Before (Energy-only) | After (+ Food Leading Indicators) |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Fuel oil F1 ~0.10 | Fuel oil F1 = **0.364** (+260%) |
| Gasoline F1 ~0.15 | Gasoline F1 = **0.222** (+50%) |

**Economic Mechanism**: Supply chains adjust to anticipated energy costs. Price movements in transportation-intensive foods (meat, citrus) may signal upcoming fuel price changes that logistics providers are already pricing in.

### 5.2 Interest Rates Provide Strong Excitation Signals

Treasury interest rates show **lagged correlations** with fuel prices:
- Government Account Series: +0.21 lagged correlation with next-month fuel
- Treasury FRN: +0.19 lagged correlation
- Treasury Notes: -0.17 lagged correlation (inverse signal)

This suggests interest rate movements may affect energy prices through:
- Storage cost dynamics (higher rates → less inventory → price volatility)
- Futures curve adjustments
- Economic activity transmission

### 5.3 The Model Learns Meaningful Cross-Excitation Patterns

The Neural Hawkes model successfully captured cross-category excitation:
- Food commodity shocks (Eggs, Flour) achieve F1 > 0.45 at H=3
- These events help predict subsequent fuel/energy shocks
- The continuous-time LSTM learns the temporal dependencies

### 5.4 Ranking Performance is Strong

At H=3 months:
- **Top-10 Hit Rate = 76.2%**: Model correctly identifies at least one true event type in top-10 predictions 76% of the time
- **Top-20 Hit Rate = 95.2%**: Nearly perfect coverage in top-20

This is highly valuable for portfolio managers monitoring which sectors to hedge.

### 5.5 Event Definition Remains Critical

The 2σ threshold creates a specific event-vs-nonevent balance:
- At H=3, positive rate is 95.2% (nearly every month has some event)
- This makes the "any-event" task nearly degenerate
- **The value is in the type ranking, not the binary detection**

### 5.6 Evaluation Protocol Matters

Standard point-process metrics (log-likelihood) don't directly answer practical questions. Our two-task framework:

1. **Any-event detection**: Relevant for risk management (F1 = 80% at H=1)
2. **Type ranking**: Relevant for sector allocation (Top-10 = 76% at H=3)

This separation reveals that the model has strong ranking ability but calibration challenges at longer horizons.

## 6. Future Research Directions

### 6.1 Expand Cross-Excitation Feature Universe

Our success with food commodities suggests incorporating more leading indicators:
- **Supply chain data**: Shipping costs (Baltic Dry Index), diesel inventories
- **Geopolitical indicators**: Sentiment scores from news, OPEC meeting outcomes
- **Agricultural futures**: Corn, wheat, soybeans (feed costs affect meat prices)

### 6.2 Higher-Frequency Data

Moving to **weekly or daily** data would:
- Increase sample size for training (10x more data points)
- Better capture short-term clustering dynamics
- Allow more granular event definitions and faster reaction times

### 6.3 Multimodal Feature Integration

Incorporating:
- **Text data**: FOMC statements, EIA reports, OPEC announcements
- **Order flow**: Treasury auction results, futures open interest
- **Cross-market signals**: Equity volatility (VIX), credit spreads, currency movements

### 6.4 Transformer-Based Hawkes Processes

Recent work (Zuo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) shows Transformers can model point processes:
- Better long-range dependencies (may capture seasonal patterns)
- Attention over event history (interpretable cross-excitation)
- Potentially better scaling with longer sequences

### 6.5 Causal Discovery and Interpretation

The learned cross-excitation patterns could be analyzed for **Granger causality**:
- Does chicken breast → fuel oil represent a causal pathway?
- Can we identify the latent "logistics cost" factor?
- Network visualization of shock propagation

### 6.6 Walk-Forward Evaluation

Expanding to a **rolling window** protocol:
- Train on 2014–2018, test on 2019
- Retrain on 2014–2019, test on 2020
- …and so on

This would provide more robust out-of-sample estimates and detect regime changes.

### 6.7 Marked Point Process Extensions

Explicitly modeling **mark distributions** (shock magnitude) could enable:
- Tail risk forecasting (extreme event probabilities)
- Value-at-Risk estimation
- Magnitude-weighted event prediction for position sizing

### 6.8 Real-Time Production System

For deployment:
- **Online learning**: Incremental updates as new events arrive
- **Alerting**: Push notifications when P(event) exceeds threshold
- **Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of cross-excitation dynamics
